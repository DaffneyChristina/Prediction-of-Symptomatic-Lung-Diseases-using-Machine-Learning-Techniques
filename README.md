Image classification based on X-RAYS
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) - CNNs are useful for finding patterns in images to recognize objects, classes, and categories.

Download Jupyter Notebook.

Import neccessary pakages like keras, tensorflow etc.

Load TRAINING, TESTING AND VALIDATION X-Rays Image datasets for COVID-19, PNEUMONIA, TUBERCULOSIS (TB).

teps to follow:
1) Download Pneumonia chest-xrays image dataset from kaggle and split it into TRAIN, TEST and VALIDATION datasets eg. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia.

2) Go to code Pneumonia XRAY test.ipynb and create a model and save it.

3) Do the same for TB(Tuberculosis)-TB testing.ipynb and Covid-19 -COVID-19 testing.ipynb.

4) Finally go to TESTING XRAY.ipynb and upload saved models of Pneumonia, TB and COVID-19 respectively.

Congratulations! Now you created a Disease Predicting Machine Learning Model.

OUTPUT RESULT :
Test each model with a new xray image and predict a result by it's accuracy.
